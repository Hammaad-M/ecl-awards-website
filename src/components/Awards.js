        The main objective of this Eastside Civic Leadership Award pilot program
        is to highlight and celebrate individuals, particularly from BIPOC,
        immigrant, and refugee communities on the Eastside, who have applied
        their talent, skills, and passion to do something positive in their
        community, whether their work is on behalf of a nonprofit organization
        or as an individual.

        We recognize that civic leadership takes many forms and doesnâ€™t always
        have to be through traditional means or related to legislative or
        political processes. We define civic leadership as anyone, regardless of
        age, who took the initiative and dedicated their time, skills, talent,
        and passion to make a positive impact or improve the quality of life in
        a community, or to address a specific community problem.
